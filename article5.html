                We strongly believe that by now and at this stage in your life, it has dawned on you that you can’t escape mathematics in any aspect of your life. It all boils down to Math. And so in our very beloved College of Pure and Applied Sciences (COPAS), we have a School of Mathematical Sciences to cater to this very necessity. Under it are two departments; The Department of Pure and Applied Sciences, and the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science.
              </p><p>
                The Department of Pure and Applied Mathematics (PAM) is an offshoot from the reorganization of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics in 2004. This resulted in the formation of the Department of Pure and Applied Mathematics (PAM) and the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science (STACS). The Department offers courses in Pure and Applied Mathematics to both undergraduate and postgraduate students.


</p><p>
What is Pure Mathematics and Applied Mathematics? Pure Mathematics involves courses that are built on the premise of logical reasoning and deduction and making valid conclusion from given statements. In a nutshell Pure Mathematics is concerned with creation of more knowledge in the areas of mathematics purely through reasoning and formulation of results (theorems) through research that are tested using proofs. Applied Mathematics is mainly concerned with applicability of results developed in mathematics through simulation of physical or theoretical systems. Okay, maybe we lost you with the explanations. Pure Mathematics is, in its own way, the poetry of logical ideas. There, now you have it.


   </p>
   <p>
    The Department currently offers five programmes: BSc. Mathematics, B.Sc Mathematics and Computer Science, BSc. Industrial Mathematics, MSc. Pure Mathematics, MSc. Applied Mathematics, Ph.D Pure Mathematics and Ph.D Applied Mathematics.
      </p><p>
        It is in the spirit of bridging the gap between knowledge and practice and promoting interdisciplinary research we are hosting a career fair on Friday 26th October 2018 at the Assembly hall. We have invited alumni from the industry to address the students on the relevance of mathematics to the industry and career prospects. We shall also have presentation from two Ph.D research fellows on ‘Modelling of stock exchange using Multigrid and hierarchical matrix methods’ and ‘Modelling SIT (Sterile Insect Technology) by mimicking processes in Nuclear Chemistry and Nuclear Physics.
      </p><p>
          </p><p>
            The career fair is open to all students from all Colleges, as well as University staff and researchers for free. Come and let’s have an adventurous mathematical experience together, will you? Do well to remember that Mathematics possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty; a beauty gold and austere. Those beautiful and mathematically proven words aren’t our own but those of the great British philosopher, logician and mathematician, Bertrand Russel. See you at the fair!
