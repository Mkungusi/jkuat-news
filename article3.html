Analytical chemistry is the science of measurement and identification of the chemical compounds that underlie most aspects of modern life and plays a central part within the chemical industry. It also involves the processing and communication of information about the composition and structure of matter.

It is offered in JKUAT main campus in Juja  in the College of Pure and Applied Sciences (COPAS)  under the School of Physical Sciences in the Chemistry Department.

The Department of Chemistry provides a high level, quality learning experience for all of its undergraduate students in both the theoretical and practical aspects of Chemistry.
